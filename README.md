# Amplitude-Modulation

## Introduction
Amplitude modulation is a technique used in communication systems to transmit information through a carrier signal by varying its amplitude. In this project, my lab partner and I collaborated to design and build an amplitude modulator and an envelope detector with multiplexing capabilities. We delved into complex subjects in physics and electrical engineering such as modulators, envelope detectors, semiconductors, subtractors, amplifiers, sine wave generators, and more. We also conducted simulations with Tina TI, MATLAB, and Excel. The project took approximately 200 hours in total.

## Explanation of Project/Technology and Code
The project involved designing and building an amplitude modulator and an envelope detector. We used a simple amplifier and subtractor circuit to modulate the amplitude of a carrier wave using a message signal. The modulated signal was then passed through an envelope detector to extract the message signal from the carrier signal. We also included multiplexing capabilities, which allowed us to transmit multiple signals simultaneously.

To design the circuit, we used Tina TI, a circuit design and simulation software. We also used MATLAB and Excel to analyze the circuit and simulate the modulated signal. The code for the circuit design and simulation is available in the repository.

## Special Consideration
When working on this project, we had to consider various factors that affect the performance of the amplitude modulator and envelope detector. One of the critical factors is the choice of semiconductor components, such as diodes and transistors. We also had to ensure that the circuit had the appropriate gain and bandwidth to transmit and receive the modulated signal effectively.

## Examples
We included examples of the modulated signal and the message signal extracted using the envelope detector in the repository. We also included screenshots of the Tina TI simulation and MATLAB analysis.

## Requirements and File Architecture
### Project requires the following components:
- Diodes
- Transistors
- Capacitors
- Resistors
- Op-amp
- Sine wave generator

## Results
We were able to successfully design and build an amplitude modulator and envelope detector with multiplexing capabilities. We tested the circuit using various message signals and carrier signals and were able to extract the message signal using the envelope detector. The modulated signal was also transmitted effectively.

## Conclusion
Amplitude modulation is an essential technique used in communication systems, and understanding how it works is crucial for any student or professional in the field of electrical engineering. This project gave us a deeper understanding of the concept and allowed us to apply the principles learned in class to a real-world problem.

## Next Steps
